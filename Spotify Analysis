# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Average danceability by artist and track:
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Top 10 artists based on popularity:
SELECT artist_name, SUM(popularity) AS total_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Artist who released the longest song:
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms AS Duration_minutes
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Average danceability for the 10 most popular songs:
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM (SELECT *
    FROM Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10) AS popular_tracks;
    
--Find Artists with High Average Danceability:
WITH artist_avg_danceability AS (
    SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, avg_danceability
FROM artist_avg_danceability
WHERE avg_danceability > (
    SELECT AVG(avg_danceability) FROM artist_avg_danceability);

--Identifying Top 10 Artists with Consistently High Popularity;
SELECT popular_artists.artist_name
FROM (
    SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS total_tracks
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    HAVING AVG(popularity) > 70
) AS popular_artists
JOIN (
    SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS total_tracks
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
) AS all_artists ON popular_artists.artist_name = all_artists.artist_name
WHERE popular_artists.total_tracks = all_artists.total_tracks
LIMIT 10;

--Finding Tracks Released by Artists with Most Popular Tracks:
WITH top_artists AS (
SELECT artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY SUM(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 5
)
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name IN (SELECT artist_name FROM top_artists)
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

--Calculating the Average Duration of Tracks for Each Artist:
SELECT artist_name, ROUND(AVG(duration_ms)*2) AS avg_duration_ms
FROM (
    SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY artist_name ORDER BY duration_ms DESC) AS rn
    FROM Spotifydata
) AS ranked_tracks
WHERE rn <= 3
GROUP BY artist_name;

--Avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track:
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--For every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;

--How can these results answer business problems or help a business out? 
--By knowing which artists and tracks have higher danceability scores, platforms can create playlists tailored to users' tastes and moods, leading to increased user engagement 
and satisfaction. Businesses can partner with popular artists for brand endorsements, sponsorships, or event appearances to reach a wider audience and enhance brand visibility. 
Knowing which artist released the longest song can help radio stations schedule programming, advertisers choose appropriate slots, and streaming platforms optimize playlist 
lengths to maintain user engagement. By analyzing the danceability of popular songs, businesses can curate playlists for events, clubs, or workouts, ensuring a lively atmosphere 
and enhancing the overall experience for attendees or users. Each of these insights derived from SQL queries can assist businesses in making data-driven decisions, improving 
customer satisfaction, and maximizing opportunities for revenue generation and brand growth within the music industry. Additionally, these analyses can contribute to the 
development of targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and strategic partnerships, ultimately driving business success and competitive advantage.
