--How can these results answer business problems or help a business out?
--This information can help identify high-value customers who make bulk purchases, allowing the business to tailor marketing strategies or loyalty programs to retain these 
customers. Knowing the popular products sold at a specific location during a particular period can help optimize inventory management and marketing efforts for those products.
